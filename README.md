# SQL-Password-Tool
You can use this to create a new account with SA Privileges or change the SA account's password if you have forgotten it.

The zip file has the project folder for Visual Studio 2017. It's relativly simple so should upgrade to 2019 if you open 
it in visual studio 2019.

Also please note this tool switches the sql instance to single user mode, and back again, so it does drop any connections 
at the time of use.
